## Recipes Database \(Updated\)

### Description

This code is used to store, track, research and share recipes. I got the application about 8 months ago from PSC from a posting by Bob Davis from Tallahassee Florida. I loved the concept and some of the recipes were cool too.

<BR><BR>

I really liked what Bob did but since I'm a database programmer I had some challenges that I was interested in tackling with regards to his initial design (plus I was board) so this is the result with a few added plus's that my wife dreamt up.

<BR><BR>

There is one thing that is bothering me about this application though and maybe you fellow coders can help me out. For some reason I cannot distribute this to any family members or friends without installing VB6 on their computers. They are using 95B and 98? I have traced it down to the Data Access pieces for the errors (particularly the compact and repair commands). I have installed the MDAC on their PC's and it does not work until I install my copy of VB (Pssst, Please Don't Tell Bill).

<BR><BR>

If you have any advice or critisisem, go ahead and let me know because there is always a better way, a different perspective or something that everyone did not think of.

<BR><BR>

Pardon some of the not so neat code. ;-)

Best Regards,

### More Info
 
This application uses the latest Microsoft Data Access pack so you will have to intall this to use it correctly (or at least I think).

Always use a code scanner.... I do have a kill and a copy command in my code for the backup/restore process. There is also a custom control that I created with source code. You may need to compile and install or use the one in the zip file if PSC let's it through.
